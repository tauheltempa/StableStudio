The film revolves around Silsila (Kunal Khemu), who is the "manager" of the traffic signal, meaning he collects the "hafta" (protection money) from each signal squatter plying his trade. He works for a local don named Jaffar (Upendra Limaye), who reports to Haji (Sudhir Mishra), a Dubai-based mafia boss. Silsila's clients include beggars, prostitutes, eunuchs, flower-sellers, drug addicts and other street vendors. He also falls in love with Rani (Neetu Chandra), a Gujarati girl who sells ethnic clothes at the signal.
 
However, Silsila's life takes a turn when he gets involved in a chain of events that threatens the very source of his income - the traffic signal itself. He is unwittingly used by Haji to carry out a murder and a bribery scheme that involves a corrupt politician (Kiran Kumar) and a builder (Rajesh Sharma) who wants to construct a flyover near the signal. Silsila is arrested and faces charges of murder, extortion and bribery. He realizes that he has been betrayed by his own boss and that his world is about to collapse. He must now choose between his life and his world.
 
Traffic Signal is a realistic and gritty portrayal of the harsh realities of Mumbai's street life. It exposes the nexus between politicians, builders, mafia and police that exploits the poor and marginalized sections of society. It also shows the human side of the street dwellers, who have their own dreams, hopes and emotions. The film received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, performances and music. It also won two other National Film Awards for Best Make-up Artist and Best Audiography.
  
The film also explores the relationships and emotions of the street dwellers, who have their own joys and sorrows. Silsila and Rani develop a romantic bond, despite their different backgrounds and aspirations. Noorie (Konkona Sen Sharma), a prostitute, cares for Dominic (Ranvir Shorey), a drug addict and a con-man, who is dying of AIDS. Tsunami (Chinmay Kambli), a little scavenger boy, dreams of going to school someday. Manya (Sandeep Kulkarni), a crippled beggar, hopes to get married to a girl from his village. Chinta Swami (Vinay Apte), a rag collector, still believes that his parents are alive after the tsunami disaster.
 
The film also raises some pertinent questions about the ethics and morality of the begging industry. Is it right to exploit the sympathy of the people by faking disabilities and diseases? Is it fair to rob the poor of their hard-earned money by threatening them with violence? Is it justified to use children and animals as props for begging? Is it humane to treat the street dwellers as sub-humans and deny them their basic rights and dignity? The film does not offer any easy answers, but leaves it to the viewers to ponder over these issues.
 
The film received mixed reviews from the critics and the audiences. Some praised it for its realistic and hard-hitting depiction of the street life, while others criticized it for its lack of coherence and depth. Some also felt that the film was too grim and depressing, without any relief or hope. The film did not do well at the box office, but won several awards and accolades at various national and international film festivals. The film also had a social impact, as it inspired some NGOs and activists to work for the welfare of the street dwellers.
