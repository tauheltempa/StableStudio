AspenONE Engineering is a suite of tools that enables users to design, model, optimize and analyze process plants and equipment. It includes products such as Aspen HYSYS, Aspen Plus, Aspen EDR and Aspen Flare System Analyzer. Some of the features and benefits of AspenONE Engineering are:
 
- Capital and energy cost optimization with streamlined workflows. Users can integrate cost estimation, energy optimization and heat exchanger design and rating (EDR) technology into the process simulation environment, allowing faster and more accurate optimal design selection earlier in the conceptual engineering phase.
- Safety improvements via increased relief sizing capabilities. Users can perform pressure relief analysis with new relief load calculation enhancements for heat exchanger tube rupture, fire emergency and control valve failure scenarios. This can reduce the time to conduct pressure relief analysis by 50 percent.
- Lower operating costs due to accurate methanol partitioning modeling. Users can model methanol behavior more effectively with the Cubic Plus Association (CPA) fluid property package, which can accurately predict hydrate formation, improving flow assurance in pipelines and meeting environmental regulations.
- Optimized throughput and planning with complete suite of reactor models. Users can access new naphtha hydrotreater and alkylation models that create a complete refinery reactor and assay management suite from within Aspen HYSYS Petroleum Refining. This allows users to model and optimize all process units and support planning for maximum profits.
- Energy savings with the extension of polymer modeling to solids. Users can treat polymers as solids below their melting points in Aspen Plus, allowing for accurate upstream and downstream modeling of solids production, including dewatering and drying.

AspenONE Manufacturing and Supply Chain is a suite of tools that enables users to optimize production scheduling, inventory management, supply chain planning and advanced process control. It includes products such as Aspen PIMS, Aspen Plant Scheduler, Aspen Inventory Management and Operations Scheduling (IMOS) and Aspen DMC3. Some of the features and benefits of AspenONE Manufacturing and Supply Chain are:

- Improved profitability with integrated planning and scheduling. Users can align production plans with market demand, optimize plant operations and logistics, reduce inventory costs and increase customer satisfaction.
- Increased efficiency with advanced process control. Users can implement adaptive control strategies that can handle complex processes, disturbances and nonlinearities, resulting in improved product quality, reduced variability and increased throughput.
- Enhanced visibility with real-time data analytics. Users can monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify root causes of issues, perform what-if scenarios and generate reports using dashboards, charts and graphs.

Aspentech Aspenone V8.0 Dvd1 (2013) was released in May 2015 by Aspen Technology, Inc., a leading provider of optimization software for the process industries[^1^]. It is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems[^2^]. It is available for purchase or download from the official website of Aspen Technology or authorized resellers.
